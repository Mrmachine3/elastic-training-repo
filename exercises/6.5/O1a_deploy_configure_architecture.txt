# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION **
# GOAL: Deploy an Elasticsearch cluster that satisfies a given set of requirements
# REQUIRED SETUP: /

# Download the the exam version of Elasticsearch
# Deploy the cluster `eoc-01-cluster`, so that it satisfies the following requirements: (i) has three nodes, named `node1`, `node2`, and `node3`, (ii) all nodes are eligible master nodes
# Configure the nodes to avoid the split brain scenario
# Configure `node1` to be a data node but not an ingest node
# Configure `node1` to bind it to the network address "127.0.0.42" and HTTP port "9201"
# Configure `node1` to disallow swapping on its host
# Configure the Zen Discovery module of `node2` and `node3` to use the address and default transport port of `node1`
# Configure the JVM settings of each node so that it uses a minimum and maximum of 8 GB for the heap
# Configure the logging settings of each node so that (i) the logs directory is not the default one, (ii) the log level for transport-related events is set to "debug"
# Configure the nodes so as to disable the possibility to delete indices using wildcards
